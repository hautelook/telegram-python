Telegram Problem

Write a program that takes a number w, then accepts lines of text and outputs lines of text, where the output lines have as many words as possible but are never longer than w characters. Words may not be split, but you may assume that no single word is too long for a line.

Please make sure the assertion succeeds and then email your answer to jamie.swain@hautelook.com.

If you prefer to use another language, no problem, just make sure you get the same answer.

Thanks!
